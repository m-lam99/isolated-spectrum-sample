# Coding sample for Isolated Spectrum

Code demonstrating primary functionality developed in Lam et al. (2024). `narrow_spectrum.py` contains all the function definitions required for calculating the isolated spectrum from time-series spectra of a fast-rotating star during an exoplanet transit event. The included Jupyter notebook provides an example of applying this method to 3 HARPS observations of WASP-189 during transit events of WASP-189 b, and calculating the average isolated spectrum. I have also included a plot comparing the out-of-transit broadened spectrum with the isolated spectrum calculated from the same nights.

This code is still under development and may have extra functionality introduced in the future, eg. incorporation with other packages, more robust error handling, etc.
